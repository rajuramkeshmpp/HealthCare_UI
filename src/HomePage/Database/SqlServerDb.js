    question: "What are the different types of joins in SQL Server?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          - <b>INNER JOIN</b>: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <b>LEFT (OUTER) JOIN</b>: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <b>RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN</b>: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <b>FULL (OUTER) JOIN</b>: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

    question: "What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          - <b>WHERE</b> is used to filter rows <i>before</i> grouping occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <b>HAVING</b> is used to filter groups <i>after</i> the GROUP BY operation.

        <pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4", padding: 10 }}>
          {`-- Using WHERE
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000;

-- Using HAVING
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount

        </pre>

    ),

  {
    question: "What are the different types of indexes in SQL Server?",
    answer:
      "Clustered Index, Non-Clustered Index, Unique Index, Full-Text Index. Clustered index sorts data rows physically in the table; Non-Clustered index contains pointers to data rows; Unique index ensures uniqueness; Full-Text index enables text search.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you find duplicate records in a SQL Server table?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Use GROUP BY with HAVING to find duplicates:</p>
        <pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4", padding: 10 }}>
          {`SELECT Name, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`}

      </>
    ),

  {
    question: "What is a stored procedure? How do you create one?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored under a name and processed as a unit. It can accept parameters and helps improve performance and security.
        </p>
        <pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4", padding: 10 }}>
          {`CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;

EXEC GetEmployeeByID @EmployeeID = 101;`}

    question: "What is normalization? Explain the different normal forms.",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Normalization is a database design technique to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1NF (First Normal Form):</b> Eliminate duplicate columns; ensure atomicity.</li>
          <li><b>2NF (Second Normal Form):</b> Meet 1NF and remove partial dependencies on a composite primary key.</li>
          <li><b>3NF (Third Normal Form):</b> Meet 2NF and remove transitive dependencies.</li>
          <li><b>BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):</b> A stronger version of 3NF.</li>

    question: "How to retrieve the current date and time in SQL Server?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Use the GETDATE() function.</p>
        <pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4", padding: 10 }}>
          {`SELECT GETDATE() AS CurrentDateTime;`}
        </pre>

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What is a transaction in SQL Server?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements executed as a single logical unit of work. It must be <i>atomic</i> â€” either all statements succeed or none.
        </p>
        <pre style={{ backgroundColor: "#f4f4f4", padding: 10 }}>
          {`BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;

COMMIT;`}
        </pre>
        <p>If something fails, you can use <b>ROLLBACK</b> to undo changes.</p>
